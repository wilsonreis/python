In order to motivate our study of statistical learning, we begin with a simple
example. Suppose that we are statistical consultants hired by a client to
investigate the association between advertising and sales of a particular
product. The Advertising data set consists of the sales of that product
in 200 diferent markets, along with advertising budgets for the product in
each of those markets for three diferent media: TV, radio, and newspaper.
The data are displayed in Figure 2.1. It is not possible for our client to
directly increase sales of the product. On the other hand, they can control
the advertising expenditure in each of the three media. Therefore, if we
determine that there is an association between advertising and sales, then
we can instruct our client to adjust advertising budgets, thereby indirectly
increasing sales. In other words, our goal is to develop an accurate model
that can be used to predict sales on the basis of the three media budgets.
