variable is an output variable. The input variables are typically denoted using the
output
variable
symbol X, with a subscript to distinguish them. So X1 might be the TV
budget, X2 the radio budget, and X3 the newspaper budget. The inputs
go by diferent names, such as predictors, independent variables, features, predictor
independent
variable
feature
or sometimes just variables. The output variable—in this case, sales—is
variable

response
dependent
variable
using the symbol Y . Throughout this book, we will use all of these terms
